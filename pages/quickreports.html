                        <h3>Scenario: Quick Reports</h3>
                        <p>Quick Reports (Beta) was a South Sound 911 application geared towards more automated police report writing.  It utilized CAD (computer-aided dispatch) data from the 911 call to create a police report in the RMS (records management system). <br><br>This application was released to a focus group for a trial period.  As a side project, I thought it would be helpful to create a journey map of the focus group's experiences.</p>

                    <h3>Goals</h3>
                    <p>Illustrate users' experience with Quick Reports; demonstrate journey mapping to project managers as a tool we could use in the future.</p>
                    <h3>Process</h3>
                    <p>This was my first attempt at a journey map, so I wanted to start simple.  I queried our databases for some basic statistics about the police reports which had originated in Quick Reports and stacked them against what I thought were reasonable objectives*.  For the qualitative feedback, I reviewed notes from the focus group, as well as notes from my field user testing with a police officer. With this data, I used Visio and JoyPixels 4.5 (<a href="https://www.joypixels.com/licenses/free">license</a>) to illustrate the situation in the journey map.</p>
                    <p><i>*Objectives are noted as pre-defined for the purpose of showing the project manager how we would go about it in the future.</i></p>
                    <h3>Outcome</h3>
                    <p>While Quick Reports was ultimately shelved, I personally found the journey map to be a great visual tool and, with more data, would use it again on future projects.</p>
