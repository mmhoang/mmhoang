<h3>Police Case Report Editor Enhancement</h3>
                <h4>Prototyping (Apr 2018)</h4>

                <p><b>Scenario:</b> The South Sound 911 development team was gearing up to add a new feature to the police case report editor.  This new feature would make it easier to import person data from the computer-aided dispatch (CAD) system, by grouping data and allowing the user to select multiple names at a time.</p>
<p><b>Goals:</b> To make the best use of our time, we wanted to get user input on the design as soon as possible.  The goal of the prototypes was to enable potential users to help us choose a design that was most intuitive for them.</p>
<p><b>Process:</b> I collaborated with my project manager to create three high-fidelity prototypes (mine is pictured).  We visited with field users to have them test out the prototypes and offer feedback.</p>
<p><b>Outcome:</b> It was fascinating to observe the users' reactions to the prototypes.  The users gravitated towards the option which gave them the most control and ability to make accurate decisions up front, rather than the most simple or "minimalist" prototype.<br><br>With that knowledge, we built on the most popular prototype to create our minimum viable product.  The new feature is now in beta and has been received with enthusiasm by other users.</p>
